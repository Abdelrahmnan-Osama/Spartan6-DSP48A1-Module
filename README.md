# Spartan6-DSP48A1-Module
Developed a high-performance DSP module for Spartan6 FPGA, utilizing the DSP48A1 slice for arithmetic operations. This project includes a modular pipeline design for flexible data path configuration and optimized throughput. The design is implemented in Verilog and tested using Xilinx Vivado and QuestaSim on an Artix-7 FPGA.
